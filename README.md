# Reacher_Continuous_Control
Reacher Continuous Control using DDPG
### Reacher Enviroment

- Set-up: Double-jointed arm which can move to target locations.
- Goal: The agents must move its hand to the goal location, and keep it there.
- Agents: The environment contains 10 agent with same Behavior Parameters.
- Agent Reward Function (independent):
  - +0.1 Each step agent's hand is in goal location.
- Behavior Parameters:
  - Vector Observation space: 26 variables corresponding to position, rotation,
    velocity, and angular velocities of the two arm rigid bodies.
  - Vector Action space: (Continuous) Size of 4, corresponding to torque
    applicable to two joints.
  - Visual Observations: None.
- Float Properties: Five
  - goal_size: radius of the goal zone
    - Default: 5
    - Recommended Minimum: 1
    - Recommended Maximum: 10
  - goal_speed: speed of the goal zone around the arm (in radians)
    - Default: 1
    - Recommended Minimum: 0.2
    - Recommended Maximum: 4
  - gravity
    - Default: 9.81
    - Recommended Minimum: 4
    - Recommended Maximum: 20
  - deviation: Magnitude of sinusoidal (cosine) deviation of the goal along the
    vertical dimension
    - Default: 0
    - Recommended Minimum: 0
    - Recommended Maximum: 5
  - deviation_freq: Frequency of the cosine deviation of the goal along the
    vertical dimension
    - Default: 0
    - Recommended Minimum: 0
    - Recommended Maximum: 3
- Benchmark Mean Reward: 30
